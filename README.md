# AI Live Code Checker

AI Live Code Checker is a web-based code editor that detects JavaScript errors in real time and explains them using a locally running AI model. It provides instant ESLint-based validation with editor-style error highlighting and AI-assisted explanations, similar to modern IDEs.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Detects JavaScript syntax and linting errors instantly  
- Highlights errors with red underlines while typing  
- Shows error details on hover (rule + message)  
- Uses a **local AI model** to explain errors  
- Works fully on the developer’s machine (no cloud APIs)  
- Non-blocking architecture for smooth typing experience
